FFpdf - Privacy and Terms
Privacy Notice
Thank you for visiting our website.

FFpdf respects your right to privacy when you use our services, visit our website or communicate electronically with us. We take all necessary measures to ensure any personal data you give us is kept secure and safe.

We are FFpdf AG, a company incorporated under the laws of China, with its registered offices at BEIJING. ‘Personal data’ is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. By providing our services to you, we may have to process personal data related to you (‘Your Personal Data’). FFpdf is the controller of Your Personal Data. By using our services, you may upload or otherwise provide files and information and process such files and information (‘User Files’ whether originally provided by you or processed by using our services) to us which may contain personal data not related to you. In such case, you remain fully responsible for such personal data contained in the User Files.

In the paragraphs below, we endeavor to answer key questions about your data privacy and Your Personal Data you share with FFpdf. These answers should inform you of both your rights regarding Your Personal Data, and the measures we take to maintain the privacy and security of Your Personal Data.

If you provide us with personal data of other people (such as family members or work colleagues) or provide us User Files which contain personal data related to other people, please make sure they are aware of this Privacy Notice and only provide us with their data if you are allowed to do so and such personal data is correct.

This Privacy Notice has been drafted to be in line with the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

If you have any requests concerning Your Personal Data or any queries with regard to these practices, please contact FFpdf at the address given above.

Key Questions and Answers
1. What personal information does FFpdf collect through its website and how is it collected?
In brief: If you use our services, regardless of whether you are a free or paying user, we will collect Your Personal Data that is required to provide our services to you and/or that will help us to improve our services for you.

By visiting any domain or subdomain of FFpdf.com, your IP address and other usage metrics will be logged along with the dates and times of access. Other of Your Personal Data that we obtain from you includes:

1.1 Account
If you create any paying FFpdf account via our website, we store data about your account in a database on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). This includes your email, name and address if you have added them in your profile. To include an additional level of security, we use cryptographic hashing to save your password. This directly implies that our employees can’t see it. We also save the plan you are on and whether you have paid with PayPal, a credit card or other payment methods, your VAT number, type of credit card or payment method information, last 4 digits of credit card, IP address, user settings, company, role, industry & employees size.

For security reasons we also save the time, browser and IP address of your last login and the time of your last password reset.

1.2 Payment
Our payment providers are Braintree and Stripe. Your credit card information or payment account (e.g. PayPal, Alipay, Apple Pay) is stored here so that we can charge you in the upcoming billing cycle, depending on your current subscription.

Any personal data you provide to Braintree, Stripe and PayPal will be processed by them in accordance with their privacy policies. Please review their privacy policies in order to understand what types of personal data they collect from you and how such data is processed.

Your full credit card number will never reach our server and will always be sent directly to Braintree or Stripe from your computer. We can only see the first and last 4 digits of your credit card.

We also store information about your subscription details in Braintree or Stripe, including: plan, status and price, first billing date, current billing period and paid-through date.

We store information about every PayPal or credit card transaction, including: payer email (for PayPal), payer name, transaction type, amount, time, and status.

Lastly, we also import information from Braintree and Stripe into Chartmogul and into AWS to get a better overview of our subscriptions. To import some of this data we use the service Stitch.

1.3 Invoices
Your invoices are stored in a database on AWS in Ireland. Here, we store detailed data relating to transactions and subscriptions from Braintree or Stripe and VAT tax-related information.

As an additional backup, the raw data used to generate the invoice database entry is also saved as a file on AWS.

1.4 Email
We use MailChimp and its add-on Mandrill to send emails to you. Here we store your name, email, country, plan and language, your signup date, last used date and expiration date. We can also see which emails we have sent to you, the email client you used, which emails you have opened and whether you have clicked on any links in them.

1.5 Errors and Improvements
We use TrackJS to discover possible javascript errors when you use our service. If an error is detected, we save this along with your browser, operating system, screen size and IP address.

We have our own custom analytics system that feeds a database on AWS. Here we save for example the pages which you have visited, the tools you have used, and which options you have chosen on our tools as well as the options during the signup process. With this, we store your browser type, operating system, your default PDF software, number of processors, your RAM, country and file sizes. On our mobile app we store additional information about how your file was created and which device you are using. All this helps us to identify errors on our site, our mobile app or our desktop app, areas that are used frequently, and things that should be improved.

In order to analyze how users access our website, understand web traffic, and determine targeted advertisements based on your preferences, some of our services use cookies. For more information, please read the question relating to Cookies below.

To improve your experience on our desktop app we track and store your operating system, the number of CPU cores your computer uses, your computer memory, and which PDF reader is your default.

1.6 Feedback and Support
Sometimes, we will ask you for feedback using Hotjar, Typeform and SurveyMonkey. We save your answers along with your name, email and IP address. Data recorded on Hotjar relating to user behavior will be used to optimize your workflows on our website.

If you send us a support ticket, it will be answered via Freshdesk.

1.7 Signature / eSign
We save your signature(s) in AWS for your convenience if you use our eSign tool.

If you are requesting a signature from someone else, the third party will have to agree to our General Terms and Conditions and to this Privacy Notice by using our services. In order to verify the signing process, we store data from all involved persons/people in AWS including their email address, the signer’s IP address, the time when the document was signed and the document status. This data is stored in the background only to prevent abuse of our services and, if necessary, to be used to investigate criminal action.

1.8 Generated data
We are generating data in order to improve our services. Such data is stored in our database on AWS or directly in a database of our third parties, e.g. as Braintree or Stripe. See more about it question 4. For analyzing how our service is used and to optimize its quality and the user experience, FFpdf may analyze and categorize Your Personal Data and User Files with a machine learning algorithm.

2. How does FFpdf protect Your Personal Data?
In brief: We do a lot to make our service as secure as possible.

FFpdf takes appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect Your Personal Data. Only authorized FFpdf staff or third-party company staff (i.e. service providers) have access to Your Personal Data. All FFpdf staff who have access to Your Personal Data are required to adhere to FFpdf’s Privacy Notice and all third-party employees who have access to Your Personal Data have signed non-disclosure agreements. In addition, FFpdf has contracts in place with third-party companies that have access to Your Personal Data in order to protect Your Personal Data. To ensure your personal information is protected, FFpdf maintains a secure IT environment and has appropriate measures in place to prevent unauthorised access (i.e. hacking). All communication and file transfers to and from our server are encrypted with SSL. Passwords are never stored in plain text for either paying or non-paying FFpdf accounts. They are encrypted (hashed) in our databank on AWS, and no one is able to read them.

We use the email address you provide us to communicate with you. If you provide us with personal data when purchasing our software, we will use that data to issue a software license to you, provide you with customer support, or issue you a refund.

All information collected from you in order to provide you with our services will be used solely for:

4. To whom does FFpdf disclose Your Personal Data, and why?
In brief: We share some of Your Personal Data with others in order to provide you with our services. Don’t worry, we will not sell Your Personal Data or give it to spammers.

FFpdf will never share Your Personal Data with any Third Party business organisation that intends to use it for direct marketing purposes unless you have given us specific permission to do so.

FFpdf may share Your Personal Data with Third Parties, but only in the strictly limited circumstances set out below:
We may supply Your Personal Data to Third Parties (such as our internet service providers) who help us administer our websites. Some of these business partners may be located outside Switzerland. These Third Parties must at all times provide the same or at least comparable level of security for Your Personal Data as FFpdf and are bound by a legal agreement to keep protect Your Personal Data and to process it only according to FFpdf’s specific instructions. All these third-party processors have to sign a non-disclosure agreement with us.
We may also supply Your Personal Data to government bodies and law enforcement agencies if: we are required to do so by applicable law; or, if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal procedures; to respond to any legal claims or actions; or to protect the rights of FFpdf or its customers and the public.
5. How can I access, check, change or delete my Personal Data and which rights do I have and how can I exercise them?
In brief: Your rights based according to Swiss Federal Data Protection Act and the EU GDPR are respected. Please also go to the “Terms and Conditions” page.

We allow you to access, modify or delete Your Personal Data. If you would like to do so, please contact us at info@FFpdf.com or at the address given above. In accordance with and as far as provided by applicable law, you have the right to access, rectification, and erasure of Your Personal Data, the right to restriction of processing or to object to our data processing in addition to receiving certain personal data for transfer to another controller (data portability). Please note, however, that we reserve the right to enforce statutory restrictions on our part, for example if we are obliged to retain or process certain data, have an overriding interest (insofar as we may invoke such interests) or need the data for asserting claims. If exercising certain rights will incur costs on you, we will notify you in advance. Please further note that exercising these rights may be in conflict with your contractual obligations and this may result in consequences such as premature contract termination or involve costs. If this is the case, we will inform you in advance unless it has already been contractually agreed upon.

In general, exercising these rights requires you to be able to prove your identity (e.g., by a copy of identification documents where your identity is not evident otherwise or can be verified in another way). In order to assert these rights, please contact us at FFpdf AG, Steinstrasse 21, 8003 Zürich, Switzerland.

In addition, every data subject has the right to enforce his/her rights in court or to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority. The competent data protection authority of Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (https://www.edoeb.admin.ch).

For more detailed information please consult the “Terms and Conditions” page.

6. How and how long do we store Personal Data, User Files and generated data?
In brief: We keep Your Personal Data only as long as it is needed for the provision of our services or required by law. As a registered FFpdf user we store your User Files for your conveniences. If you do not have an account we keep your User Files long enough for you to download or process them. The time required to upload, process and convert User Files varies from tool to tool.

We will only retain Your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with legal, regulatory or internal policy requirements. To help us do this, we apply criteria to determine the appropriate periods for retaining Your Personal Data depending on its purpose, such as account maintenance, facilitating client relationship management, and responding to legal claims or requests from authorities. In general, FFpdf may retain personal data for the period of your relationship or contract with us plus 10 years, reflecting the retention period according to Swiss law and the length of time for which legal claims may be made following termination of such relationship or contract. An ongoing or anticipated legal or regulatory proceeding may lead to retention beyond this period.

If you have a FFpdf account and you are logged in, it doesn’t matter if you are a paying user or not, we will save your User Files and store them in our database on AWS.

We have to inform you 14, 7 and 1 day in advance by sending an email if FFpdf will delete your User Files.

All the files uploaded for processing on FFpdf.com are stored on an appropriate server infrastructure for processing and the download afterwards. The time we keep User Files varies from tool to tool, as some tools require longer saving periods (eg. eSign). In most tools we delete the files after one hour. We only store User Files and generated data for longer than an hour,

if the additional storage time is required to provide our service, for example if the recipient of a User File shared with a tool, including but not limited to our eSign tool, needs more time for downloading the User File;
for analyzing how our service is used to optimize its quality and the user experience.
7. Which countries will your personal information be sent to and why?
In brief: We transfer your personal data outside of Switzerland and ensure that your personal data is well protected irrespective of its location.

When you use our services, Your Personal Data and User Files may be transferred to and from servers located in other countries. Further, User Files (whether originally provided by you or processed by using our services) are not shared with third parties, unless such parties are subject to confidentiality obligations.

If we transfer data to a country without adequate legal data protection, we ensure an appropriate level of protection as legally required by way of using appropriate contracts or binding corporate rules or we rely on the statutory exceptions of consent, performance of contracts, the establishment, exercise or enforcement of legal claims, overriding public interests, published personal data or because it is necessary to protect the integrity of the persons concerned.

If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of submission, you or FFpdf must resolve any claims relating to these terms, the Services, or the Software through final and binding arbitration, except that you or FFpdf may assert claims before the courts of the Canton of Zürich, Switzerland.

12.2 Rules
If you or FFpdf decide to resort to arbitration as per the foregoing paragraph, the Swiss Chambers’ Arbitration Institution will administer the arbitration in Zürich under the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration. There will be one arbitrator that you and FFpdf both select. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered and will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction having jurisdiction over the parties.

12.3 No Class Actions
You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.

12.4 Injunctive Relief
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of your or others’ unauthorized access to or use of the Services or content in violation of these terms you agree that we are entitled to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

13. Compliance with Licenses
If you are a business, company, or organization, then we may, no more than once every 12 months, upon seven 7 days’ prior notice to you, appoint our personnel or an independent third party auditor who is obliged to maintain confidentiality to inspect (including manual inspection, electronic methods, or both) your records, systems, and facilities to verify that your installation and use of any and all Software or Services is in conformity with its valid licenses from us. Additionally, you will provide us with all records and information requested by us in order to verify that its installation and use of any and all Software and Services is in conformity with your valid licenses from us within 30 days of our request. If the verification discloses a shortfall in licenses for the Software or Services, you will immediately acquire any necessary licenses, subscriptions, and any applicable back maintenance and support. If the underpaid fees exceed 5% of the value of the payable license fees, then you will also pay for our reasonable cost of conducting the verification.

14. Modification
We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service or Software in order to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services or Software. You should look at the terms regularly. We will post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We will post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service or Software. By continuing to use or access the Services or Software after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
